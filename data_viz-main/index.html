				<h2>Types of Storefronts</h2>
			</div>
			<p>After the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NYC Department of Finance began collecting datapoints on
				the 75,000 storefronts found across the city. The dataset, which covers just the following two years of
				the pandemic, captures the types of occupied storefronts, as well as the number of vacant storefronts,
				labeled as "No business activity identified." In both years, the vacancy rate remained around 13%.</p>

				<h2>Vacancy Rate vs. Land Price</h2>
			</div>
			<p>This scatterplot aims to explore the correlation between storefront vacancy rates and unit land
				prices of the buildings in each NTA region. Since land value can be a good indicator of how wealthy a
				neighborhood is, comparing vacancy rates with the median land price can suggest
				whether the storefronts in less wealthy neighborhoods experience more vacancies than
				wealthier neighborhoods during the pandemic.<br><br>

				<i>The size of the circle indicates the number of the storefronts in each NTA. You can click through
					each borough to see how each compares to the rest of New York. You can also hover over each circle
					for details. </i>

				<h2>Vacancies Across New York City Neighborhoods</h2>
			</div>
			<p>As COVID-19 battered New York City in 2019, neighborhoods experienced changes in storefront vacancies
				that varied greatly by geographic location.
				Once popular tourist destinations, neighborhoods like Hudson Yards and Midtown experienced a sharp
				decline in business activity that was well documented.
				Other neighborhoods, like Flushing and Astoria in Queens, experienced severe increases in vacancies
				while receiving less attention. <br><br>

				<i>Feel free to explore the distribution of vacancies in 2020, 2021, and the change from one versus the
					other. Zoom into the neighborhoods to
					identify vacant storefronts, and click to obtain additional information.</i>

				<h2>Reported Vacancies vs. On-the-Ground Observations</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Open data from the City confirms that neighborhoods such as Astoria were hit particularly hard. However,
				because only what is reported is displayed,
				itâ€™s important to understand how reported data matches lived experiences on the ground. The next step in
				our investigation will be to conduct site visits
				to Astoria, particularly on Steinway St, to see how reported data matches the lived experience on the
				ground.</p>

			<p>Stay tuned for those results!</p>
