							<h1>Evaluation of New York City Green Rooftop Building Incentives</h1>

                            <h2>Introduction </h2>

The Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE), combined sewage overflow, and poor air quality pose serious threats to residents of New York City. To mitigate these threats, NYC enacted policies promoting green rooftop construction. This paper explores inequalities in their implementation, then proposes ways where they can more equitably distribute benefits to frontline communities.The Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE) occurs when non-reflective, heat collecting, and impervious surfaces replace areas of vegetation, causing increased surface temperatures in cities relative to surrounding areas.1 Greener rooftops promote cool air flow, absorption of heat for photosynthesis, and shading for asphalt. Dense cities possess many impervious surfaces which exacerbate the UHIE, particularly in communities which generally enjoy fewer greenspaces compared to more affluent areas.2
During storms, water flowing from impervious surfaces carry contaminants into sewage treatment systems. However, combined sewer systems are designed to discharge contents into NYC’s waterways when overtaxed, which can lead to water pollution concerns. Since scientists predict that severe storms will increase in frequency and severity due to climate change, these facilities risk becoming further strained. Green rooftops relieve pressure on sewers by retaining 50-70% of fallen rainwater.3 NYC’s aging building stock often use oil and gas combustion which release greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollutants such as NOx and SOx. As a significant emitter of air pollutants, buildings lower air quality for residents and increase incidents of respiratory illness. Green rooftops directly mitigate these effects by filtering pollutants. According to The Nature Conservancy, there is significant potential in NYC’s rooftops, since its buildings cover about 40,000 acres, while only 730 buildings possessed green rooftops in 2016.4 Figure 1 shows green rooftops counts in NYC, which generally concentrate in wealthier areas.</p>
